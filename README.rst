NOW INCLUDED IN RESPONSIVEKIT https://github.com/angeloc/web2py-responsivekit

====================
Responsive tables for web2py
====================

This plugin makes responsives all web2py tables such as your own custom, the ones in appadmin, generated by SQLFORM 
and so on.

It's only a matter of importing the plugin package with the admin interface and extend the base
layout as explained in the book Chapter 29 http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/12#Layout-plugins.

Plugin layout is based on web2py stable version one (1.99.4 at the time of writing), I'll try to keep in sync 
with the mainlaine. I hope that this plugin will be taken for inclusion, meanwhile here it is!

If you want to use this plugin in you custom layout, you have to include this code:

::

<!--[if !IE]><!-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{=URL('static','plugin_layout_responsivetables/responsive-tables.css')}}" />
<script src="{{=URL('static','plugin_layout_responsivetables/responsive-tables.js')}}"></script>
<!--<![endif]-->

It's important to include the conditional directives for IE, because IE doesn't supports this responsive tables design, 
so it's disabled.

Plugin works changing table's aspect on the fly when the resolution of target device is smaller than 700 pixels,
it uses a combination of css media queries and javascript to accomplish the goal. 
If you want to change the resolution you have to edit both the css and the javascript 
(replacing 700 with your desired value).
