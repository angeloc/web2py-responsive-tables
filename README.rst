====================
Responsive tables for web2py
====================

This plugin makes responsives all web2py tables such as your own custom, the ones in appadmin, generated by SQLFORM 
and so on.

It's only a matter of importing the plugin package with the admin interface and extend the base
layout as explained in the book Chapter 29 http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/12#Layout-plugins.

Plugin layout is based on web2py stable version one (1.99.4 at the time of writing), I'll try to keep in sync 
with the mainlaine. I hope that this plugin will be taken for inclusion, meanwhile here it is!

If you want to use this plugin in you custom layout, you have to include this code:

::

<!--[if !IE]><!-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{=URL('static','plugin_layout_responsivetables/responsive-tables.css')}}" />
<script src="{{=URL('static','plugin_layout_responsivetables/responsive-tables.js')}}"></script>
<!--<![endif]-->

It's important to include the conditional directives for IE, because IE doesn't supports this responsive tables design, 
so it's disabled.
